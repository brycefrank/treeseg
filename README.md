# treeseg

A library of tree segmentation and detection algorithms.

For general LiDAR processing tasks (e.g. normalization, canopy height models, etc.) please see [pyfor](https://github.com/brycefrank/pyfor).

## Planned and Current Algorithms

### Detection

- [x] `FixedWindowLocalMaxima`
- [ ] `VariableWindowLocalMaxima`

### Segmentation

- [ ] `Vornoi`
- [ ] `Watershed`

Please send your suggestions to the [issues](https://github.com/brycefrank/treeseg/issues) board.

## Requirements

```
- skimage
- pyproj
- rasterio
- scipy
```

## Installation

Forthcoming.
